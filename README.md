# REAL-TIME-OBJECT-MEASUREMENT
Real-time object measurement is a program for detecting the dimensions of objects in real time.  The process of computing the dimensions has four stages: (1) capturing an image (2) object measurement process (3) saving output (4) displaying output.  A white paper  background is used to detect the object. After locating the object, it shows its dimensions in specified measuring units in real time. The OpenCV software library of Python is used to implement the proposed technique. 
A box of pre-defined dimensions is created on the white page and then the object is placed on the sheet and then the image is loaded into the system, considering the box size as a reference the dimensions of the object are given.
In the folder called images we can see the objects placed on the sheet and the reference box is drawn on the top-left.
The file init.py contains the Python source code
