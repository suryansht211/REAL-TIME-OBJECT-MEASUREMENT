# REAL-TIME-OBJECT-MEASUREMENT
The real time object measurement is a program for detecting the dimensions of  objects in real time. In these days of rapid technological development, real time detection and dimensioning of the objects is an important aspect from an industrial point of view. This is one of the computer vision problems where a lot of research work is going on. This project presents a technique for computing the measurements in real-time from images. The project presented here determines the dimensions of the object by using some hardware and software resources. The hardware resources utilized here is just a webcam, and with respect to the software resources we have used the python programming language and libraries like Numpy and OpenCv. OpenCv includes many libraries and algorithms that are used in this project. The process of computing the dimensions has four stages: (1) capturing image (2) object measurement process (3) save output (4) displaying output. To explain itâ€™s working it basically uses a webcam and a white paper background to detect the object. After locating the object, it shows its dimensions in specified measuring units at real time. In the implementation of the proposed technique, we designed a system that used the OpenCV software library.
