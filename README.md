# REAL-TIME-OBJECT-MEASUREMENT
Real-time object measurement is a program for detecting the dimensions of objects in real time.  The process of computing the dimensions has four stages: (1) capturing an image (2) object measurement process (3) saving output (4) displaying output.  A white paper  background is used to detect the object. After locating the object, it shows its dimensions in specified measuring units in real time. The OpenCV software library of python is used to implement the proposed technique.
